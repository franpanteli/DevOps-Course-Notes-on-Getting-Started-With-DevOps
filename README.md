# DevOps-Course-Notes-on-Getting-Started-With-DevOps
This repository contains my notes on the LinkedIn Learning pathway called 'Getting Started with DevOps'. This is a selection of 5 video courses on various aspects of DevOps engineering - intended to be taken together to provide a holistic view of the field.  I wrote these notes with the intent of publishing them as a reference resource, with each txt file corresponding to a DevOps course I completed in the learning pathway. 

This is a list of the various files in this repository and a description of the associated course and instructor name: 
* *Course Title: DevOps Foundations: Monitoring and Observability*
  *  Description: Monitoring is a key practice area of modern operations. In this course, explore techniques and tools for monitoring from a DevOps mindset. Instructors Ernest Mueller and Peco Karayanev spell out what monitoring is, what's unique about the DevOps approach to monitoring, and how to model your system so monitoring makes sense in context. Next, they examine the different types of monitoring instrumentation, including how to implement synthetic monitoring, end user monitoring, system monitoring, and network monitoring. They also cover best practices for architecting systems for observability and share how to overcome common obstacles.
* *Course Title: DevOps Foundations: Infrastructure as Code*
  *  Description: Infrastructure automation—transitioning an organization's system administration from hardware into code—is one of the major DevOps practice areas. By automating configuration management, you can make your systems more reliable, processes more repeatable, and server provisioning more efficient. In this course, learn the basics of infrastructure as code, including how to keep your configuration in a source code repository and have it built and deployed just like an application.   Discover how to approach converting your systems over to becoming fully automated—from server configuration to application installation to runtime orchestration. Join notable DevOps practitioners Ernest Mueller and James Wickett as they dive into key concepts, and use a wide variety of tools to illustrate those concepts, including Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless, and AWS Lambda. Check out this course to gain the knowledge you need to start implementing an infrastructure as code strategy.
* *Course Title: DevOps Foundations: Your First Project*
  *  Description: Curious about how to put DevOps principles into practice? This course can help. Join Carlos Nunez as he demonstrates how to apply DevOps principles to a sample app for a fictitious travel booking company. Throughout the course, Carlos shows how to leverage popular tools and methodologies to make updating, testing, and releasing the app a breeze. After explaining how to containerize the website with Docker and Docker Compose, he shows how to write unit and integration tests with RSpec, Capybara, and Selenium. He then steps through how to deploy your website into the cloud with Terraform and write a Jenkinsfile that will build, test, and deploy your app. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll know how to turn a slow and complex application development process into a fast and enjoyable one.
* *Course Title: DevOps Foundations*
  *  Description: DevOps is not a framework or a workflow. It's a culture that is overtaking the business world. DevOps ensures collaboration and communication between software engineers (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). With DevOps, changes make it to production faster. Resources are easier to share. And large-scale systems are easier to manage and maintain.  In this course, well-known DevOps practitioners Ernest Mueller and James Wickett provide an overview of the DevOps movement, focusing on the core value of CAMS (culture, automation, measurement, and sharing). They cover the various methodologies and tools an organization can adopt to transition into DevOps, looking at both agile and lean project management principles and how old-school principles like ITIL, ITSM, and SDLC fit within DevOps.   The course concludes with a discussion of the three main tenants of DevOps—infrastructure automation, continuous delivery, and reliability engineering—as well as some additional resources and a brief look into what the future holds as organizations transition from the cloud to serverless architecture
* *Course Title: DevOps Foundations: Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration*
  *  Description: Continuous delivery is one of the major DevOps practice areas. By continuously building, testing, and delivering your code, you can reap huge stability, speed, and flexibility benefits. In this course, learn about continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and see how these concepts work in practice by constructing your own build pipeline. Throughout the course, instructors James Wickett and Ernest Mueller discuss elements of the pipeline as they show how to take an app written in the Golang programming language from development to production. They walk through version control, building artifacts, unit testing, and deployment, demonstrating common practices and tools along the way. They conclude with some practical advice on CI/CD best practices and common pitfalls, workarounds, and compromises that you may encounter on your journey to continuous delivery.
